Go programming language

by Robert Griesemer,  Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson
-c like language
-inspired by the concept of communicating sequential processes

-> if the program is more than a one shot expirement better use
    $ go build command

- go code is organized into packages
-package main defines a standalone executable program , not a library

- there is no while loop in go programming language

for a tradition "while" loop :
for condition {

}

### for a traditional infinite loop we can use
for {

}

-whenever you are utilizing a for loop with a range functionality you have to deal with its index


variables can be expressed
    s := ""
    var s string
    var s = ""
    var s string = ""
the first one is compact and used in functions not packages

the fmt.printf is used for outputting a formatted string ( and does not write a new line by default)
